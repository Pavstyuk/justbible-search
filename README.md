# Just Bible Search

The plugin is made specifically for Christian-themed websites. It helps to conveniently and quickly integrate a search for words in the Bible into any WordPress website. You just need to insert a standard short code on the desired page and that's it - you have a full-fledged Bible search on your website.

The plugin has three built-in translations, one English and two Russian.

The search results include the ability to load the entire chapter of the found Bible verse

The search works quite quickly due to the fact that it stores Bible translations in json files in its structure and does not access external servers.
